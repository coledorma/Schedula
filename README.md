## Carleton Course Scheduling App
This project will serve as an aid to Carleton students to easily create their course schedule for upcoming semesters, during registration. Our main goal is to be able to generate unconflicted schedules based on the general course codes provided by each student.

Additionally, this project will aim to include features such as:
* Requesting specific days off
* Prioritizing courses during a certain time of day (morning/afternoon/evening)
* Exporting class schedule to external calendar applications (google/android/email)
* Importing external calendars in order to incorporate personal schedule
* etc...
